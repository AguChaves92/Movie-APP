The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

The website will fetch random movies from the themoviedb database, sort the by popularity and render in home.
I used a very horizontal scroll to render all 20 movies originally fetched

Star Ratings

Basic star rating filter. WIll only show movies with averga votes equal to double the start value, or double the start value minus 1.

Search bar brings all movies with the word in the title.
